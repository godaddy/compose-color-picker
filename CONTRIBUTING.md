# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to GoDaddy's Open Source Software.
Contributing doesn’t just mean submitting pull requests. To get involved,
you can report or triage bugs, and participate in discussions on the
evolution of each project.

No matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn what’s
expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading the Contribution
Guidelines and our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## Answering Questions

One of the most important and immediate ways you can support this project is
to answer questions on [Github][issues]. Whether you’re
helping a newcomer understand a feature or troubleshooting an edge case with a
seasoned developer, your knowledge and experience with a programming language
can go a long way to help others.

## Reporting Bugs

**Do not report potential security vulnerabilities here. Refer to
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for more details about the process of reporting
security vulnerabilities.**

Before submitting a ticket, please search our [Issue Tracker][issues] to make
sure it does not already exist and have a simple replication of the behavior. If
the issue is isolated to one of the dependencies of this project, please create
a Github issue in that project. All dependencies should be open source software
and can be found on Github.

Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist:
  - Create it on the project's [issue Tracker][issues].
  - Clearly describe the issue by following the template layout
    - Make sure to include steps to reproduce the bug.
    - A reproducible (unit) test could be helpful in solving the bug.
    - Describe the environment that (re)produced the problem.

## Triaging bugs or contributing code

If you're triaging a bug, first make sure that you can reproduce it. Once a bug
can be reproduced, reduce it to the smallest amount of code possible. Reasoning
about a sample or unit test that reproduces a bug in just a few lines of code
is easier than reasoning about a longer sample.

From a practical perspective, contributions are as simple as:
1. Fork and clone the repo, [see Github's instructions if you need help.][fork]
1. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`
1. Make changes on the branch of your forked repository.
1. When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about
  the fix.
1. Please also add/update unit tests for your changes.
1. Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'main
   development branch' branch of the projects' repository.

If you are interested in making a large change and feel unsure about its overall
effect, start with opening an Issue in the project's [Issue Tracker][issues]
with a high-level proposal and discuss it with the core contributors through
Github comments. After reaching a consensus with core
contributors about the change, discuss the best way to go about implementing it.

> Tip: Keep your main branch pointing at the original repository and make
>  pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>   ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/godaddy/compose-color-picker.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
>   ```
>   This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
>   fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local main
>   branch to use the upstream main branch whenever you run git pull. Then you
>   can make all of your pull request branches based on this main branch.
>   Whenever you want to update your version of main, do a regular git pull.

## Code Review

Any open source project relies heavily on code review to improve software
quality. All significant changes, by all developers, must be reviewed before
they are committed to the repository. Code reviews are conducted on GitHub
through comments on pull requests or commits. The developer responsible for a
code change is also responsible for making all necessary review-related changes.

Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you would hope for, especially for
larger features. Here are some accepted ways to speed up review times for your
patches:

- Review other people’s changes. If you help out, others will more likely be
willing to do the same for you.
- Split your change into multiple smaller changes. The smaller your change,
the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick look at it.

**Note that anyone is welcome to review and give feedback on a change, but only
people with commit access to the repository can approve it.**

## Attribution of Changes

When contributors submit a change to this project, after that change is
approved, other developers with commit access may commit it for the author. When
doing so, it is important to retain correct attribution of the contribution.
Generally speaking, Git handles attribution automatically.

## Code Style and Documentation

Ensure that your contribution follows the standards set by the project's style
guide with respect to patterns, naming, documentation and testing.
